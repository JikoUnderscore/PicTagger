# Picture tagging program

I have a lot of picture that I want to tag but could not find a small and usefull software. So I made this FOR MY USE CASE.


## Requierments
- `python`
- `exiftool` in the path



## Notes
- it works on my machine. dont care about yours
- all files and all paths must be in ASCII, i do not know how to fix this ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯, keywords/tags can be in Cyrilic/utf8
